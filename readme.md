# Healthcare Scheduling

The HealthcareSchedule class is a Python-based optimization tool designed for healthcare staff scheduling. It leverages the PuLP library to create a Linear Programming (LP) model that assigns shifts to staff members while satisfying a variety of constraints and optimizing for fairness and efficiency. The class also includes methods for analyzing, visualizing, and exporting the generated schedules.

# Constraints

Constraints are modular and designed to be customizable. These allow the user to fine-tune the schedule by adjusting penalty weights, thresholds, or specific rules.

## How Constraints Enable Customization

1.	Penalty Weights:
	â€¢	Constraints like isolated days, shift distribution, and weekend fairness use penalty weights. Adjusting these weights alters the priority of the corresponding rule in the optimization process.
2.	Flexible Thresholds:
	â€¢	Many constraints accept parameters such as max_days_in_7, day_shift_tolerance, and night_shift_tolerance. These can be modified to reflect organizational policies.
3.	Binary Variables:
	â€¢	Binary decision variables (isolated_work_var, weekend_work_var) allow fine-grained control over specific scheduling nuances.
4.	Role-Specific Rules:
	â€¢	Constraints like _add_role_specific_shift_constraints ensure that staff members are only assigned to roles they are trained for.

## Setup

use python enviornment manager to start a terminal with correct env

run
```bash
python3 main.py
```
you might have to install a bunch of thing, noone really knows how package management works in python.

Define worker preferences
